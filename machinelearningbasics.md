Cross-validation:

Computationally expensive, but does not waste too much data;

The bias of an estimator is its average error for different training sets.

The variance of an estimator indicates how sensitive it is to varying training sets. 
[[Biasâ€“variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)]

Validation curve:

Compare Training score and Validation score;

Learning Curve:

Training and Validation score change as number of samples;
